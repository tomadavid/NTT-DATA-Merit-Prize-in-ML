# Cancer Classification with RBF Networks

This project was developed as part of the **NTT DATA ML Merit Prize** to explore machine learning techniques for health data. It uses a **Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network** to classify cancer data into categories like benign or malignant.  

---

## What It Does

- Loads cancer data with features and labels.  
- Uses an RBF network to learn patterns in the data.  
- Follows the work presented on the PDF document.
- Can predict whether a new sample is likely benign or malignant.

## Key Points

- Explores how RBF networks classify data.  
- Simple, educational example of machine learning applied to health datasets.  
- Developed as part of the **NTT DATA ML Merit Prize** to showcase practical ML experimentation.
